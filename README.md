# canvas-video-playground
Testing ground for exploring frame-precise video manipulation . This repo serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various video playback, frame extraction, and manipulation techniques within a Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS environment. 

# WebCodecs API
One of the tests relies heavily on the WebCodecs API for both rendering individual frames and syncing video and audio. Big ups to the W3C team and the contributors to [W3C](https://w3c.github.io/).
